Alyssa is an open-source small language model built using PyTorch.  
The goal of this project is to provide a clear, minimal, and fully understandable implementation of a transformer-based language model for learning, experimentation, and research.
It is designed to be simple enough for students and beginners to understand, while still showing the core components that power modern language models.
